# Multi-Channel-Queue-Simulation-System-for-a-Petrol-Station-

• Developed a discrete-event simulation system based on OOP principles for a multi-channel queue at a petrol station, analyzing  
customer behavior and service efficiency.  
• Developed an experimental design to evaluate queue dynamics, service times, and waiting times across different fuel types. 
• Performed results analysis using statistical graphs to determine queue lengths, waiting probabilities, and pump idle times. 
• Built comprehensive documentation, detailing problem formulation, system components, experimental parameters, 
results analysis, and conclusions.
